Description: simplified clone of smartmatch operator
 match::simple provides a simple match operator "|M|" that acts like a
 sane subset of the (as of Perl 5.18) deprecated smart match operator.
 Unlike smart match, the behaviour of the match is determined entirely
 by the operand on the right hand side.
